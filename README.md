# TCP-client-server
The files implement a TCP Client and Server that does a three-way handshake, a well-known protocol sequence used in communication networks.

The TCP Server is imlpemented in three different ways:
1) Single-Threaded
2) Multi-Threaded Concurrent
3) Concurrent Server with Event-Driven Techniques

A local loopback address (127.0.0.1) is used as the default IP address for all clients and the server.
